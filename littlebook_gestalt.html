    <h1>New Models for Growth and Profitability</h1>
    <p>The book titled New Models for Growth and Profitability is a small book, about 2inches wide and 3 inches tall. Each page consists mostly of photography and graphics. Images are present only on the right side of the book, with the left side indicating the section the reader is on. The typeface used seems to be a sans-serif font with little to no variations in size. Each chapter begins with a page of table of contents highliting the section the reader is on. Each section has its own icon that is explained at the end of the book.</p>

    <p>This book utilizes similarity to show the relationship between elements. The table of contents are similar in format, with a green background, same font, same text size, left justified, and situated on the right side of the page. Color is used to indicate which sections the reader went through—blue—, which section the reader is on—white—, and which section the reader is yet to look at—light green. On certain pages, there are silhouettes of people within the images, which seemingly utilizes the closure/negative space aspect of the gestalt principle.  </p>

    <p>Overall, I really liked the simplicity of this book. The size works well with the content as it seems to me that this book deals mostly with every day topics so the small size makes it easy to carry. It was interesting to see that each section started off with the whole table of content and in using colors to indicate where you are, it gives a website like quality where the links you've already visited turn a different color.</p>
