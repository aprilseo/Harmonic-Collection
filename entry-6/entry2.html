    <p>Rainy Friday afternoon on the 3 Train
        <br>
        The lights kept flickering as all of us were trying to go home. The man in the middle kept swaying back and forth as the train kept stopping. Everybody tired, everybody wanting the lights to stop flickering. It got to a point where people started to complain, tension rising inside the train. </p>
